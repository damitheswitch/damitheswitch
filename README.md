### 🌟 About Me

I'm a curious and dedicated backend developer who started this journey because I love building things that work under the hood—reliable, scalable, secure, and meaningful.

💡 I'm currently learning through the **ALX SE Program**, diving deep into:

- 🔍 **Advanced SQL & Python** for data manipulation and powerful backend logic  
- 🧠 **Project planning & database design** to build solid foundations  
- 🧪 **Testing techniques** to ensure code quality  
- 🔧 **Shell scripting & DevOps fundamentals**  
- 🚀 **CI/CD pipelines & microservices architecture**  
- 🔐 **Security best practices & performance tuning**  
- 🐞 **Bug reporting & network traffic analysis**  
- 🧱 **Django & Full-Stack Projects** (backend-focused)
