## 🌟 About Me

I am a final-year Computer Science student at **China Jiliang University** (GPA: 86.3%), passionate about intelligent systems, real-world AI applications, and building complete production-ready software.

My academic path began in Life Sciences before I transitioned fully into Computer Science. That shift strengthened my analytical thinking and pushed me toward solving complex technical problems using data, algorithms, and automation.

I currently work as an **AI Agent Engineer** building production AI systems for e-commerce automation, while completing my graduation thesis in Computer Vision focused on traffic analysis and multi-object detection.

### 💡 Current Focus
- 🤖 AI Agents and workflow automation  
- 👁️ Real-time Computer Vision systems  
- 📊 Applied Machine Learning and decision systems  
- 🧠 Reinforcement Learning (Andrew Ng Specialization)
